 Chef's Menu application

 

Introduction  


The project's main idea/ goal is all about enhancing us the students to make use of what we have learnt so far in MAST with regards to Typescript , JavaScript as well as Recat-Native as programing languages to develop Android , Ios and web-based applications . 

 

About the application. 


The Chef's menu application is an application that both a chef and his clients use to accsess the prepared menu. this specific project/application mainly focuses on the chef's side of things though. The application essentailly entails of 3 screens , the home-screen , the add-Item screen as well as a customer's screen . 

 

About the Home screen. 

The home screen mainly entails of the total number of prepared menu items , the dish description , the course under which the meal falls , as well as the average price of the dishes and the price per dishes .
The home screen is initially blank until the user(chef) makes use of the app and makes his desired changes from the second screen(Edit-item).
The home screen is essentally also the clients-screen as , only the chef has access  to the second screen.


About the edit/add-item screen . 

The application opens on the home screen , until the chef presses the add-item button on at the bottom of the screen which takes him to the second screen .
The second screen mainly entails of a flatlist and picker where the details(dish-name , price , description , dish-courses) are stored .
The chef adds dishes to his prepared menu and as soons as he saves his progress , the app automatically updates the changes on the home screen . 
The chef can add as many dishes as he would like to , and each time he does this the total number of prepared menu items are automatically updated on the home screen . 

 

Challenges faced and areas of improvement . 

Overall the project was challenging  enouh , and time-consuming. it required extennsive research ,and going back to previously done programs that we did in Class with our lecturer .
The biggest challenge i faced throughout the completion of this projects was not realy about the code itself , but rather about the dependencies in the package.json file and the ConfigPackage.json as some of the dependencies' versions and fonts were not acsepted by visual studio ,and in return affect how the application is ran through bluestacks and the emulator.
I eventually had to even Comment out my installed fonts and fonts-familly as my poject would not run .
